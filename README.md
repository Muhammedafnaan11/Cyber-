 Network Forensics Investigation – Suspicious Insider Activity on ANZ Network using wireshark and hex editor

 
Project Description:
This repository documents a network forensics investigation conducted on a suspicious activity report involving a user on the ANZ corporate network. The investigation was performed by analyzing a packet capture (PCAP) file using Wireshark and Hex Editor tools to extract digital artifacts, decode hidden data, and reconstruct file access history.

The goal was to uncover whether the user engaged in unauthorized or malicious activities such as viewing sensitive images, downloading criminal content, or accessing hidden documents.
Objective:

To examine packet-level network activity from a compromised machine and extract the following:
Images viewed by the user
Files downloaded, including suspicious documents and PDFs
Hidden content or obfuscated data
Suspicious behavior patterns based on data inspection

Tools Used:
Wireshark – For deep packet inspection and file extraction
HxD / Hex Fiend (Hex Editor) – For raw byte-level analysis and identifying hidden content
